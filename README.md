# Songs-to-Learn-2.0
This project involves the planning and coding of a console-based program in Python 3. Its purpose is to enhance skills in utilizing various programming concepts, such as selection, repetition, file input/output, exceptions, lists, functions, and string formatting. The program serves as a song list management tool, enabling users to track their progress in learning songs. It interacts with a file that contains a list of songs, including information like title, artist, year, and a status indicating whether the song has been learned or not. Users have the option to view the list of songs, which is sorted by artist and title.

The complexity of the program is extended by introducing advanced code constructs, including dictionaries, classes, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). I have created both a console program and a GUI program, utilizing Python 3 and the Kivy toolkit. The GUI program will provide a user-friendly interface for managing the song list. It also involved techniques such as selection, repetition, exceptions, lists, file input/output, and functions, while also gaining experience in working with classes and developing graphical interfaces.

Completing both the console program and the GUI program will help solidify my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and equip me with valuable skills for software development. These projects pave the way towards becoming a proficient Python developer, empowering you to tackle real-world programming challenges effectively.
